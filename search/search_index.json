No one is hurting more than the players, and it is important we empathise while still asking the tough questions. While no over-the-top reaction is required, it is important to take stock and introspect. Analyse what went wrong, and why it happens time and again with the women\u2019s team. The one difference between Australia\u2019s approach and India\u2019s lies in the fear of failure. Australia played without fear, while the India were scared of losing. It made Australia aggressive and India defensive. Do Harmanpreet Kaur and Smriti Mandhana not have the shots? They absolutely do and we have seen that multiple times in the past. However, the urge to play themselves in, and take a few extra balls without trying to attack is because they don\u2019t want to fail. Rather, they were trying too hard. Just like in the Commonwealth Games final (2022) against Australia, where India were overcharged, in this match too, the players were desperate not to fail. As a result, they turned defensive. It was a 130-run pitch. India conceded 20 more with bad captaincy calls. It was a safety-first approach and it backfired. This is where one has to question the team and the coaching unit. What exactly was Amol Muzumdar\u2019s role? Why is it that the team looked mentally scared going into the game? Except for the game against Sri Lanka where Harmanpreet teed off in the last five and pushed India to a competitive total, in every other match, India let balls go without attacking the bowlers. There were 31 dot balls last night. And this has to be attributed to a mindset. Can Deepti Sharma not play shots? Of course she can. But here, she seemed desperate not to get out, and as a result even full tosses were batted off to long-on and not really attacked. Is this approach a result of pressure that the Indian team is always under? It is time to take a step back, and think what went wrong and how we can improve. Dubai and Sharjah 2024 is now history. No amount of criticism will get India to the semi-final unless Pakistan beat New Zealand. Rather, we need a new vision for the format. A T20 roadmap of sorts, which will define our approach in the next two years. The India A performances in Australia were nothing to write home about either. And that\u2019s where things don\u2019t look good at all. That India have the money is known. That we have the Women\u2019s Premier League (WPL) is now a given. There is no reason why we cannot win a world event. And yet, we haven\u2019t ever done so. So, let\u2019s hit the nail on the head. Let\u2019s address the core issue \u2013 fear of failure. If our players are able to overcome this inner fear, there\u2019s no reason why we won\u2019t win. Australia played freely and won. They leaned on a tried-and-tested approach, whereas India tried to balance everything out. Australia and New Zealand went all in against India. We did not. In T20 cricket, safety-first won\u2019t work. The men are an example, and the faster the women come to terms with it too, the better. This is where we need to start afresh. May be under a new leader. Is Smriti that person? Has she done enough in big games to deserve the captaincy? Can we experiment with a new approach and make a new beginning with someone else? Remember 2007 and Mahendra Singh Dhoni? The defeat is history. The future is in our hands. Oct 15, 2024 Without honest introspection, India can\u2019t move forward from this World Cup debacle As I sit down to write this piece, India\u2019s Women\u2019s T20 World Cup campaign is over. Inconsistency and the inability to chase down totals has impacted the team hard, and the pressure, needless to say, will mount on the captain and the coach. Interestingly, it has always come down to that one crucial game for India in key tournaments. In the 2022 Commonwealth Games final, it was the very same Australia. The script was the same in the T20 World Cup semi-final in 2023. India lost to Australia and were out. That 2024 has been no different is what leads me to introspect. India played four matches in the World Cup and lost two. We won against Pakistan, yes, but that win hurt us more than anything. In all, it has been a very poor campaign. And yet, we hear the coach saying this is a very special group. We hear players saying we fielded well, and the coach say Australia got over the line because of experience. This is where things start to get problematic. It takes courage to own up and say we played badly. We weren\u2019t good enough and need to get better. We weren\u2019t really there in this World Cup. To say anything to the contrary is a defensive reaction and doesn\u2019t really help. And that\u2019s where Amol Muzumdar needs to do things differently. While it is good that the head coach tries to stand up for his players, it is also important for him not to turn a blind eye to reality. India haven\u2019t fielded well, and that\u2019s the reality. We weren\u2019t good enough with the bat either. To not accept that is counter-productive. Is this an emotional rant, or is it based on rational, objective analysis? It is a fact that Smriti Mandhana has had a poor World Cup. She looked jaded and hasn\u2019t been able to give the starts that India expected of her. We need to accept this. For only then can we feel optimistic about the future. It is because she has the experience to bounce back when chips are down. She has been in tough situations before, and has the ability to change things. And isn\u2019t sport more about failure than success? Isn\u2019t that what makes sport what it is? But unless we accept the bad, which is the problem with Muzumdar at the moment, can there be anything good round the corner? Sport is that unique platform which forces a performer to fail in full public view. In every other sphere, failure is an acutely personal experience. Sport, however, is different. That India have not done well is in the public domain, and a recorded fact. But again, that\u2019s where sport redeems itself. It is the only platform which also allows a performer to come back and win in public. With the help of your team and support unit, you can recuperate and come back and prove to the world who you are and what you are made of. In sum, redeem yourself in the full public gaze and make a difference. That\u2019s what I am expecting India to do going forward. For, in the end, sport is also about hope and fulfilment. It is about stories of courage and success, and triumph against adversity. When the Indian women\u2019s team made the finals of the 2005 World Cup, few celebrated the achievement. Jhulan Goswami and Mithali Raj still had to travel in unreserved compartments sitting next to the toilets on occasion. Those days are long gone, and come the WPL, millions will be in front of their television sets to cheer the players. The players are now stars. With stardom comes responsibility, and the need to be accountable. They need to introspect and, subsequently, deliver. Accept the failure, and get ready for a comeback. While it is not fair to look too far ahead, it can certainly be said that India need fresh thinking. The time is now. To run away from this reality would be the worst outcome possible.","title":"2020 - 2029"},{"location":"2020_29/#published-between-2020-29","text":"","title":"Published between 2020 - 29"},{"location":"2020_29/#oct-14-2024","text":"Without addressing fear of failure, India\u2019s women will continue to slip up by Boria Majumdar As the dust settles on India\u2019s defeat and we come to terms with yet another World Cup exit, unless Pakistan script a miracle tonight, it is important to keep calm and exercise restraint.
